Hi Claude, I'm working on a dual-purpose online service currently hosted on a VPS. Here's the high-level architecture and current status:

ðŸ”¦ Project Overview
I have two services I want to run side-by-side:

1. Internet Lighthouse â€“ hosted on litehaus.online
Purpose: a public terminal-accessible 'lighthouse' that sends/receives realtime ping-style messages.

Currently reachable at:
nc 161.35.248.233 9876

It is working, but I'd like to upgrade it to the latest, most robust version that I developed earlier (which was local-only). I want this upgraded version to:

Continue to run publicly.

Respond to listeners.

Log/display incoming messages.

Optionally send pings outbound or serve as a relay for fastping below.

2. FastPing Return Service â€“ hosted on fastping.it.com
Purpose: a super high-speed, low-latency ping return subscription service.

Key features:

JSON-optimized responses using RTC-level JSON handling code.

Accepts pings and returns them in ultra-low-latency configurable formats.

Currently being prepared for Docker deployment and PayPal-based subscription system.

Code is nearly complete.

âœ… Goals
Please help me:

Upgrade and deploy the best version of the lighthouse + listener pair (was previously local-only) as the new public instance on 161.35.248.233:9876.

Design and deploy a new website at https://litehaus.online that:

Explains what the Lighthouse is.

Gives nc or terminal instructions on how to connect from anywhere.

Displays the real-time Lighthouse traffic (using a web display backed by the listener).

Cross-promotes the FastPing subscription service.

Finish off and deploy fastping.it.com, making sure:

It works in Docker.

It runs alongside the Lighthouse (same VPS).

It optionally integrates with the Lighthouse (e.g., sends or relays pings via the same socket/IP).

It has a working PayPal or stripe-powered subscription model.

Ensure harmony between both services â€” they shouldn't conflict (e.g. port clashes), and should optionally work together (e.g., FastPing uses Lighthouse as a reflector).

ðŸ§© Important Notes
Some of this code was written across many Claude prompts and may only be partially retained.

Feel free to ask me for any missing code â€” I have local copies I can paste in.

Start with a plan: confirm the architecture, deployment strategy, service integration points.

Then proceed step-by-step: lighthouse upgrade â†’ litehaus site â†’ fastping service â†’ integration.

Let me know what you need from me first: I can provide the latest code you previously helped me write, configuration files, Docker setups, etc. Just say the word and Iâ€™ll paste them in.

Letâ€™s build this clean and right. ðŸ§
